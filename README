#### Web-native science fiction builder/puzzle game

The aim of the project is to create an epistemic game to teach players how to think like a creative professional in web or game design. As noted by epistemicgames.org:

*"Creative professionals learn innovative thinking through training that is very different from traditional academic classrooms because innovative thinking means more than just knowing the right answers on a test. It also means having real-world skills, high standards and professional values, and a particular way of thinking about problems and justifying solutions."*

Kaiopua is a science fiction builder puzzle game, in which the player assumes the role of a young tinkerer named Kai. Kai is stranded on a behemoth organism named Opua, who needs Kai's help with a series of organic design problems so that he may grow into a strong and vibrant planetary animal. The game will be accessible and playable via website, and will not require any third party plug-ins or software beyond the web browser of player's choice.
