1.0.09.17.2011

####Section Description
Intro section of website will be composed of both the game's introduction and the game's tutorial, presented in an interactive way that introduces the player to the character, world, and story while also teaching them how to play the game. Setting will be a small Taro farming area in Hawaii, starting the player in the main character's shack.

##Basics
####Summary
* Section following Launcher.
* Second ranked in terms of smallest total file size relative to all game sections.
* Introduction to character, world, and story.
* Tutorial for game's basic mechanics.
* Transition from Launcher section by taking final render / screenshot of Launcher scene and seamlessly transitioning into intro scene.

####Introduction
* Setting: 
    * Player character's shack
    * Taro farming area
    * Small village
    * Large paddy fields of Taro plants
    * Dirt paths lined by grass
    * Shallow irrigation rivers
    * Small bridges
* NPCs:
    * Adult farmers working in fields
    * All other farmers look similar to main player character, but larger, thinner, older
    * Some small animals or critters wandering around
* Semi-Linear path:
    * Begins inside character's shack
        * Character sitting on bed staring at wall painting
        * Single room
        * Simple bed
        * Wall with large painting textured by Launcher section scene for seamless transition
        * Character's pack basket hanging on door
        * Door of shack closed
    * Leads past adult farmers working in fields, who wave and may call out a greeting to player
    * Player tasked to harvest Taro from the ripe crop field that has turned yellow
    * As player harvests Taro:
        * Animals or objects may pop out for player to collect
        * Ground begins to shake
        * Random Taro plants get sucked into ground
    * Once enough Taro is harvested:
        * Giant worm burst up and eats entire field and player
        * Transition into full game

####Tutorial
* Teaches player basics of game mechanics
* Basic movement starts inside character's shack
* Interacting with game objects starts by:
    * Character picks up object (pack basket)
    * Character uses object (places pack basket on back)
    * Character opens door to get outside
* Player movement blocked by object or animal that must be jumped over
* Player speaks with NPC (auto prompt or player initiated?) along path to get harvest task
* Player interacts with Taro plants to pick up and put in pack basket
* Player learns about failure conditions by harvesting too many green plants, which may punch or berate player when pulled out of ground
* Player learns about progression conditions by harvesting yellow plants, which reward player with health and an Aloha!
* Player learns about completion of puzzles by harvesting enough yellow plants without getting knocked out by too many green plants
* If player knocked out, wakes up in character shack (i.e. tutorial restarts)
