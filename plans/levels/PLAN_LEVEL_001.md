2.0.09.27.2011

####Level Description
The player will work within the realm of the Hawaiian god of the life and spirit, Kane. The Hawaiian islands receive most of their rain on the north and east sides due to the trade winds. This ring will respect the rainfall patterns of the islands by having abundant plant life on the north and east sides, while the south and west sides will have more clearings. Forest areas on the ring will act like mazes while also blocking the light, and will be home to many spirits. The player will use light and spirits to solve puzzles and work their way from the start of the ring around to the power source.
