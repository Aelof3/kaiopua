####In One Sentence
A space whale and a farmer have formed a symbiotic relationship where the farmer lives happily on the whale, and in return cultivates fields of taro to help maintain the whale's health

##Game Mechanics

####Overview
Players live through a series of days, where each day they keep the whale healthy by solving a farming puzzle that requires the use of a limited plant supply to fill a field with a unique shape

####Its like...
Tetris, but instead the goal is to fill the entire space(field), which itself changes shape with each level(day), using as few pieces(plants) as possible

####Daily Farming Puzzles
*   Each day the surface of the whale changes into a new puzzle
*   To complete the puzzle and move to the next day, the player must use that day's limited plant supply to exactly fill the field(s)
*   A player can place and dig up plants as many times as necessary, so no day can be failed

####Modular Fields
*   Each field is constructed by a modular grid of square units
*   A basic field may occupy space along 2 dimensions, i.e. it lies only along the surface
*   An advanced field may occupy space along 3 dimensions, i.e. it lies along the surface as well as occupying space away from the surface
*   Fields may include grid units that cannot be planted on or only allow certain plants

####Plants of Varied Shape
*   Each plant occupies space in terms of the field grid units
*   Basic plants occupy only a single space
*   Intermediate plants occupy multiple connected spaces (ex: a box of four spaces, or a line of four spaces)
*   Advanced plants occupy multiple disconnected spaces (ex: two corners of a box)
*   Specialty plants unlock spaces or give special properties to other plants (ex: use an fire plant to melt a frozen area of spaces for other plants)

####Rewards
*   Two reward types for completing each day are new plant types and companion animals
*   New plants may take new shapes or have special properties, and help the player solve puzzles further in the game
*   Companion animals follow the character and act as vanity items (visual modifiers to the character or game's appearance)
*   A player may have one companion animal present at a time

##Concepts Taught

####Modular or object oriented thinking
The player has to activate all available spaces in a grid using modular objects, and must understand how these modular elements fit together.

####Layout design
Players must plan how all the individual elements work together as a whole to satisfy the requirements of the problem.

####Individual characteristics and functionality
Players must be aware of the individual properties of each element and how that affects both nearby elements as well as the entire design.

####Color Theory
Players will have control of a number of differently colored elements and must be aware of the color schemes created by the combination of elements.
