####Level Description
The name Kai’Opua comes from Hawaiian culture, known as the opua or pink cumulus cloud formations that hang low over ‘kai’, the ocean. These clouds are regarded as omens of good fortune and good weather, and the player will begin their journey here. On this ring there are four islands: one large, one medium, and two small. The large island is the player’s starting location, on which is located the travel blowhole and a small beach-shack with the player’s first ability object. Within sight of this island is a medium sized island with the ring’s power source and a small pink/purple air balloon. The two small islands are around the ring by 135 and 225 degrees from the starting island, and are each locations of the second and third ability objects. In this ring, the clouds float low enough that the two small islands appear to be flat topped mountains rising through the cloud line. The player will use the clouds and wind to solve puzzles and work their way from the starting island around to find the second and third ability objects, and use all three ability objects to reach the power source.
