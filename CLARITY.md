Collin Hover

Graduate student in Visual Communication at University of Texas at Arlington



##What is this project?

~
A thesis project for a Masters degree in Visual Communication intended to demonstrate high level design

~
A 360 degree experience that is both meaningful and playful, while including modules for determining success

~
A way to teach web design to an audience ranging from ages 12 - 18

~
A website built to be accessed from anywhere

~
A game that feels friendly and intuitive but is still full of surprises

~
A way to explain the importance of efficiency in visual communication

~
A game that conditions players to value efficiency when solving problems

~
A game that gives the player the ability to change the size of any object



##Why does this project matter?

~
Students are proficient in using digital tools to create websites, but do not understand what makes the tools work, yet they believe their proficiency is what matters

~
This is like knowing the answer to a math problem, but not knowing how or why that answer is the correct one

~
For the same reason, you cannot solve web design problems without first knowing how those problems work

~
Web designers, just like any other creative professional, have a mental framework they use to understand problems and create solutions

~
This involves a number of concerns common to all designers, such as structure, function vs form, and audience

~
This also involves special emphasis placed on values such as usability, interactivity, accessibility, and efficiency

~
Usability is walking a mile in someone's shoes to make a friendly solution

~
Interactivity is reacting to someone's choices to bring them an engaging solution

~
Accessibility is knowing that you cannot control someone's technology, so we make a flexible solution

~
Efficiency is understanding no one has all the time in the world, so we need a simple solution

~
And of all the aspects of web design I've mentioned, efficiency has the clearest measure of right and wrong

~
This is because we can measure how quickly, cleanly, and clearly you can reach a goal

~
Without changing the goal itself

~
This makes efficiency a very strong candidate for a game based learning situation

~
Within web design, efficiency is minimizing the time someone spends doing unnecessary activities on a website

~
Waiting for the site to load is by far the worst of these activities

~
How fast can you download a website? This is a terrible question

~
How long will someone wait for a website to load? This is a much better question

~
The key here is the size of the resources the website uses to reach its goal

~
The more files we need to load and the bigger they are, the longer we have to wait

~
We care about someone's tolerance for waiting because if someone doesn't wait for a website to load, the website does not exist

~
The difficulty for a web designer is controlling the number and size of the files

~
Because it isn't as easy as just making everything as small as possible or using the same image 100 times

~
Images need to be the right size for the layout

~
And code files that the user never sees should be minified

~
A web designer's task of controlling the size of resources is mirrored in the game

~
Players will have the ability to change the size of objects in their environment to solve puzzles

~
This mechanic is very simple: the player can either make an object larger and heavier, or smaller and lighter

~
Let me give you an example puzzle from the game world using this mechanic, and at the same time give you a real world equivalent

~
The game world, a giant space worm whale from Hawaii, is hungry and wants to eat a mossy boulder, but can't get the boulder for itself

~
Meanwhile, a web designer has been asked to create a website for people to research high resolution images of rocks 

~
Our valiant player, the guardian of the space worm, sets out to fix the hunger problem and finds a colossal boulder covered in moss, but it is far too heavy to move

~
Our game player also knows that he only has until sundown to find a solution, or else the space worm will have to eat him to survive!

~
In the other galaxy, the web designer finds that the images he has are so large that they would take users hours to load, and he knows not even the greatest rock researchers will wait that long

~
However, if the web designer can't find a solution before the project deadline, he'll be out of a job!

~
Thinking quickly, our game player zaps the boulder down into a small stone, just the right size for him to carry and still big enough to give the space worm a satisfying meal

~
Back in our web designer's world, he has resized his images so that users of his website can download them in seconds and still get enough detail to give satisfying information

~
Both the player and the designer have used efficient design thinking to remove barriers and create a smoothly flowing experience

~
In the game hero's case, his problem was the worm's hunger needs, and how he could deliver the correct food type in the right amounts before the worm got tired of waiting and ate him instead

~
On the web designer's side, his problem was the researcher's image needs, and how he could deliver the correct images at a big enough size to use for research, without making researchers endure unacceptable download times

~
Crisis averted! Highfive!

~
The visual experience of the game should not be forgotten, because it has a heavy influence on the attitude of the player

~
The character and environment designs are all made to communicate as much as possible with as little as necessary

~
They are also designed to be friendly and playful, so as to be approachable

~
As well as attempting to be strange and altruistic, so as to be interesting and believable

~
And finally, they are based on Hawaiian culture, but more on that later!




##How do we define a successful thesis?

~
A successful thesis in this case would be the solution that is both meaningful and playful

~
Players participating in a meaningful experience will choose to change the way they think

~
An obvious attempt at indoctrination will be instantly rejected by the player

~
Players participating in a playful experience may be more likely to adopt new information

~
A third space is defined as somewhere between formal instruction and free play

~
Its suggested that the third space is optimal for meaningful experiences

~
Games are a very strong third space

~
Players enjoy themselves by successfully playing by the rules

~
In playing by the rules, a player must use them to approach problem solving

~
Two products will define this project as successful: a written discourse and a playable game

~
Written discourse will utilize high level design concepts to explain:

~
the proposition that this game will help players solve real world web design problems

~
what real world web design problems exist that are difficult to solve

~
why these problems are difficult to solve and why it is difficult to teach others to solve them

~
how this game will teach players to better approach these problems

~
and as possible, real cases of the success of the game

~
The playable game will include:

~
An animated character and world

~
A place for the character to live, as well as an environment for the world to exist in

~
Working player movement and 3D physics

~
Working player ability to control the size of object in the world

~
Colored visuals

~
A single puzzle that demonstrates why efficiency is important and how to use it

~
Limited game music and environment sound effects




##Why Hawaii?

~
Calling the world 'Efficient-Land-Ville' would be like using a jack-hammer to drive in a nail

~
The setting should contrast from reality to be interesting but believable in its structure

~
Hawaii and Hawaiian culture is mysterious, attractive, and has high contrast from both western and eastern culture

~
Hawaiian culture is one I grew up in and worthy of sharing through tangential methods

~
Tangential learning is when a reference is made in the game to something that may also exist outside the game world, and the player researches about it on his/her own
