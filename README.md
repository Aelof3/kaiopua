Kaiopua
========

####Web-native science fiction builder / puzzle game

The aim of the project is to create an epistemic game to teach players how to think more like a creative professional in web design. Tangentially, also about Hawaii! As noted by epistemicgames.org:

*"Creative professionals learn innovative thinking through training that is very different from traditional academic classrooms because innovative thinking means more than just knowing the right answers on a test. It also means having real-world skills, high standards and professional values, and a particular way of thinking about problems and justifying solutions."*

Kaiopua is a science fiction builder / puzzle game, in which the player assumes the role of a simple boy named Iki. Iki is stranded on a moon sized worm-like creature named Kaiopua, who is broken and needs help to restore power to his life systems. The game will be accessible and playable via website, and will not require any third party plug-ins or software beyond the web browser of player's choice.

####Core Goal
Create a game in which a player develops and adopts a piece of a professional web designer's problem solving framework. Notable modules of solving problems as a web designer may include:

* Small file sizes - solving problem efficiently with smallest number of resources
* Browser Accessibility - making sure everyone gets the same experience
* Ease of use (navigation) - good use of hierarchy so everyone has a frustration free experience
* Cloud - use existing resources from a central location that users may already have
* Dynamic experience - each experience is manipulated to fit the current situation
* Semantic content - every part of a design is tagged with meaning
* HTML, CSS, and JS - separation of structure, form, and interactivity
* Meticulousness - making sure your design is error free
