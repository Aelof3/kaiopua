####Web-native science fiction puzzle game

[Project Explanation Presentation](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/collinhover/kaiopua/kaiopua_clarity_doc.pdf) - [Game Plan v6](https://github.com/collinhover/kaiopua/blob/master/plans/README.md "Game Plan v6") - [Game Website](http://collinhover.github.com/kaiopua) (placeholder) - [TODO List](https://github.com/collinhover/kaiopua/blob/master/TODO.md)

The aim of the project is to create an epistemic game to teach players how to think more like a creative professional in design. Tangentially, also about Hawaii! As noted by epistemicgames.org:

*"Creative professionals learn innovative thinking through training that is very different from traditional academic classrooms because innovative thinking means more than just knowing the right answers on a test. It also means having real-world skills, high standards and professional values, and a particular way of thinking about problems and justifying solutions."*

Kaiopua is a science fiction builder / puzzle game, in which the player assumes the role of a simple boy named Iki. Iki is stranded on a moon sized whale-like creature named Kai 'Opua, who is sick and needs help to return to health. The game will be accessible and playable via website, and will not require any third party plug-ins or software beyond the web browser of player's choice.

####Core Goal
The core goal of the project is to create a universal design education tool, primarily targetted at players of both genders of ages 10 - 14, to teach them to better understand grid, spacing, order, modularity, and efficiency within design.

##Brief
####Target Audience
The core audience will be teenage students, roughly ages 10 - 14 and of all genders. These will be individuals do not approach their world like a designer of interactive virtual media does, but should have an interest in solving problems and role-playing new identities. Additionally, a wider play audience from ages 10-30 may be considered as a secondary range, but primary focus will be placed on the core audience. Players will have at least basic knowledge of computers and Internet navigation.

####Problem Addressed
The designer of interactive virtual media is a creative discipline that seeks innovative ways of communicating ideas and generating form in a global economy pushing very hard towards complete technological connectivity. This type of designer must be able to visualize entire interactive systems such as a websites or a games, while simultaneously knowing each sub-system (or data structure) and the functional relationships they create when combined. They understand and work through patterns of creative logic.  
  
Through teaching, research, and work with colleagues, I’ve found that this epistemology, or way of thinking, is a very difficult thing to establish in those individuals who would best benefit from such a design framework. The designer of interactive virtual media is a subset of the graphic designer, also known as the visual communicator, which is a general discipline most often practiced by those seeking to control communication through form and function. This general discipline is currently dominated by creative visual thinking that has a tendency to avoid math, science, and logic, which has developed into a fear of and inability to address non-standardized problems of interactive, flexible, and user-aware solutions.

####Background
James Paul Gee, a researcher in education and gaming asked a question some years ago: “Are today’s schools preparing our children for tomorrow’s world?” His concern is not his alone. His question is preceded and followed by other researchers such as Dewey, Piaget, McLuhan, Papert, and Shaffer, all of whom seem to agree that the education system as it has stood, unchanged, for over a hundred years, is now creating a very dangerous problem. As Gee laments, “[Today’s students] can’t use the rote learning and standardized skills they got in school to think in innovative ways,” and Shaffer explains that: “In the very near future, the only good jobs left will be for people who can do innovative and creative work.” Current school content, those standardized facts and skills Gee is referring to, is the stable rock for contemporary education. It is focusing all on the message, and nothing on the medium, while our students focus on standardized skills and not on innovative solutions.  
  
McLuhan spoke of “the medium is the message,” meaning that the structure or framework of the medium by which a message is relayed is more important than the content contained by the medium itself. Without a highly flexible, interactive, and refined method of communication (medium), even the most enlightening message means nothing.  
  
Epistemic gaming is one solution to the growing problems of the education system, and attempts to teach people to think like creative professionals, using games that simulate and relay the skills, knowledge, values, and identities of those professionals. By allowing the user to adopt the identity of a professional in a particular creative community, their way of thinking becomes an internalized epistemic framework. This framework can then be taken and used outside the original community as a way to think about problems, and decide, explain, and justify decisions according to the norms of that particular creative professional. An epistemic game creates a medium for the innovative processing of and response to external messages.  

####Solution Abstract
It is crucial to the success of this game that the player be in the mindset local to his/her third space. A third space, as defined by Shaffer, is a space “between formal instruction and free play... when the primary focus is on learning rather than on market forces in commercial game production or on the institutional imperatives of schools as they currently exist.” That is, the player should not perceive the presence of ulterior learning and epistemic motives, as this may cause a negative reaction in the player. Nor should the player be in a television induced zombie-like state, as they will not also not absorb anything at that point. To teach the intended epistemic framework to a player in the third space, this project will translate the actual profession, epistemology, and learning outcomes of the interactive virtual media designer into their fictional equivalents. To highlight these fictional equivalents, their real-world counterparts will follow each in parenthesis below.  
  
The project seeks to utilize the teachings of epistemic gaming in the form of a game that takes place on Kaiopua, a moon sized worm-like organism allowing rapid prototyping and building of biomimetic systems for the purpose of interactive communication (the creative work environment or IDE). The game casts the player in the role of a simple boy (the interactive virtual media designer) named Iki who lives on Kaiopua. With his home world suddenly disturbed, the player has no choice but to help Kaiopua to uncover the mysteries of this unknown disruption and help it grow. Initially, the system will begin as a broken creature (the empty virtual medium) with a series of objects (functional elements) player can collect and use to solve puzzles (sub-systems or data structures) to help the organism grow. As the player begins to explore, observe, and unlock all the puzzles, they will begin to understand the many ways in which these objects interact (understanding patterns of creative logic vs specific use cases) as they solve increasingly complex puzzles. More importantly, in order to solve more advanced puzzles, the player must learn to envision the entire system and the inner workings of all its parts to succeed. In succeeding, the player has built an entire playful and vibrant creature (a website).  
  
####Communication Results
*    Enable students to experience what Seymour Papert termed hard fun: “the kind of fun you have when you work on something difficult, something that you care about, and finally master it.” Students cannot do this if they are stymied by an inability to absorb the content or message for a lack of suitable medium.
*    A framework for thinking through patterns of creative logic that are absorbed and adopted naturally through gaming.
*    Creation of a web framework for gaming based communication and education.
*    Establish a setting and story that players care about exploring and being a part of.
*    ‘Ah-hah’ player moment where they can look back and see how their play has changed entire game world.
