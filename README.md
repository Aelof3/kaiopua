[Paper](https://github.com/collinhover/kaiopua/blob/master/PAPER.md) - [Game Plan v6](https://github.com/collinhover/kaiopua/blob/master/plans/README.md "Game Plan v6") - [Game Website](http://collinhover.github.com/kaiopua) (placeholder) - [TODO List](https://github.com/collinhover/kaiopua/blob/master/TODO.md)

The aim of the project is to create an epistemic game to teach players how to think more like a creative professional in design. Tangentially, also about Hawaii! As noted by epistemicgames.org:

*"Creative professionals learn innovative thinking through training that is very different from traditional academic classrooms because innovative thinking means more than just knowing the right answers on a test. It also means having real-world skills, high standards and professional values, and a particular way of thinking about problems and justifying solutions."*

Kaiopua is a science fiction builder / puzzle game, in which the player assumes the role of a simple boy named Iki. Iki is stranded on a moon sized whale-like creature named Kai 'Opua, who is sick and needs help to return to health. The game will be accessible and playable via website, and will not require any third party plug-ins or software beyond the web browser of player's choice.

####Core Goal
The core goal of the project is to create a universal design education tool, primarily targetted at players of both genders of ages 10 - 14, to teach them to better understand grid, spacing, order, modularity, and efficiency within design.
