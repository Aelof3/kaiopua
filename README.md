####Web-native science fiction builder / puzzle game

[Project Plan](https://github.com/collinhover/kaiopua/blob/master/plans/README.md "Project Plan") - [Game Website](http://collinhover.github.com/kaiopua) (placeholder) - [Contributors](https://github.com/collinhover/kaiopua/contributors "Contributors") - [TODO List](https://github.com/collinhover/kaiopua/blob/master/TODO.md)

The aim of the project is to create an epistemic game to teach players how to think more like a creative professional in web design. Tangentially, also about Hawaii! As noted by epistemicgames.org:

*"Creative professionals learn innovative thinking through training that is very different from traditional academic classrooms because innovative thinking means more than just knowing the right answers on a test. It also means having real-world skills, high standards and professional values, and a particular way of thinking about problems and justifying solutions."*

Kaiopua is a science fiction builder / puzzle game, in which the player assumes the role of a simple boy named Iki. Iki is stranded on a moon sized worm-like creature named Kaiopua, who is broken and needs help to restore power to his life systems. The game will be accessible and playable via website, and will not require any third party plug-ins or software beyond the web browser of player's choice.

####Core Goal
The core goal of the project is to teach players how to solve communication and design problems efficiently. When a web designer creates a website to solve a communication problem, they use a set of professional values to figure out what the boundaries of the project are and how to find the right solution within those constraints. Communication efficiency is one of those core values, where a web designer uses the smallest number of resources in the most efficient way to add as much to a user's experience as possible. This can manifest in multiple areas of web design: loading and delivery of content is the most literal, while the layout of the site (i.e. navigation and sections) is perhaps the most difficult. 

Because everything on the web is stored somewhere remote, loading and delivery time is an unforgiving constraint of web design. A user arrives at a website with a preconceived idea of how long they expect to spend waiting for the site to load and how long they plan to browse. Breaking a user's loading patience, which is often very low, is the equivalent of not having a website at all.

The layout of a website is heavily influenced by efficiency in a number of ways, but most notable is usability. If a website is well organized and well planned, users will find it easy to use because it is friendly and not overwhelming. Efficiency used in this way is about hierarchy of information and is similar to what was said by Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry: "A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."
